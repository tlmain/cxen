        <template>short_description=Stock allocated to a deleted customer account DAP edit required^instructions=A user will call advising that they are unable to clear down a sales order as a customer account has been deleted. This happens when a customer account is deleted from Sales Ledger and hence from the live Reality system when there is an outstanding sale or sales for that customer on the branch system. 
Sales order number(s)^affected_system=Branch Systems (RPN)^cmdb_ci=SFT-STKMGMT-RPN^close_notes=Locate the account number of the customer that has been deleted by doing a sales order enquiry on the ticket in question. You will note that there is a message next to the account number saying that the customer has been deleted since the order was raised.
 
Created dummy Account    in the GD.CUSTOMER record using FLC
Ask the branch to clear down the sales order whilst on the phone.

IMPORTANT  Once the order has been cleared down you MUST delete the dummy A/C again in FLC.
